## About ℹ️

So_long is a small 2D game project developed as part of the 42 curriculum. Navigate the player through the map to collect all collectibles and reach the exit.

## Rules 📜

- You must collect all the collectibles (`C`) before reaching the exit (`E`).
- The player (`P`) can move up, down, left, and right through empty spaces (`0`). 
- Walls (`1`) block movement.
- The map must be valid and enclosed by walls.
- Use keys `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` to move. ⬆️⬅️⬇️➡️
- Press `ESC` or close the window to exit the game.

## How to Run 🚀

1. Extract the `minilibx-linux` folder in your project root (make sure it is not zipped).
2. Run `make` to build the project. 🛠️
3. Launch the game with `./so_long maps/your_map.ber`. 

## Requirements ⚙️

- Linux OS with X11 🐧
- 42 school coding norms compliance 📚
- MinilibX library (must be extracted and compiled) 

## Notes 📝

- The game window size adjusts automatically based on the map size.
- The map files must follow the `.ber` format.
